# `vim` configuration files

## `.vimrc`

This `.vimrc` file was started from this
[gist](https://gist.github.com/rbf/10285648cba3931561e4) which dates back to
August 2012.

## TODOs

- [ ] Move the install url to point to this new repository instead of the
  original gist.
- [ ] Create a funciton (maybe in .zshrc?) to update the `.vimrc` file from
  this repository.
