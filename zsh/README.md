# `zsh` configuration files

## `.zshrc`

This `.zshrc` file was started inspired from the previous `.bashrc` files from
this [gist](https://gist.github.com/rbf/1844923) which dates back to February
2012.

## TODOs

- [ ] Move the install url to point to this new repository instead of the
  original gist.
- [ ] Create a funciton (maybe in .zshrc?) to update the `.zshrc` file from
  this repository.
