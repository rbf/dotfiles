# `tmux` configuration files

## `.tmux.conf`

This `.tmux.conf` file was started from this
[gist](https://gist.github.com/rbf/3529029) which dates back to August 2012.

## TODOs

- [ ] Move the install url to point to this new repository instead of the
  original gist.
- [ ] Create a funciton (maybe in .zshrc?) to update the `.tmux.conf` file from
  this repository.
